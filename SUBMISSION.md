This assignment involves developing a personal portfolio website using HTML5. The primary goal is to design and build a well-organized, accessible webpage that highlights personal details, educational background, work experience, projects, extracurricular activities, and multimedia content. This assignment was completed using HTML elements, maintaining a clear document structure, and adhering to best practices for accessibility and usability. I built the HTML structure using elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, and footer. The header showcases my name, profile picture, and university, while the nav provides smooth scrolling links. The main content is divided into sections for About Me, Education, Experience (which is displayed in a table), Projects with images, Extracurricular Activities, and multimedia elements like an embedded YouTube video and Google Maps location. I also added a meta viewport tag to ensure the design is responsive.
