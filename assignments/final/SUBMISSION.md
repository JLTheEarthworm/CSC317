# Reflection – Assignment 5: Group Project

For our group project, we built a full-stack web application called Schedule Creator that allows users to create and manage events. It was hosted on Render to demonstrate deployment of a real working product.

My main contributions were focused on the frontend. I worked on designing and refining the user interface to make it responsive and accessible across devices. I also collaborated with my teammates using Git to merge changes and debug issues.

Through this project, I learned how to work better in a team using GitHub for collaboration and how frontend and backend components work together in a live environment. It gave me real insight into what it’s like to build something as a group and see it actually come to life.
