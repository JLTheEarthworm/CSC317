## JavaScript Environment Setup & Portfolio Integration

This assignment introduced me to JavaScript programming through environment setup, building a fully functional calculator, and integrating that calculator into my portfolio site from Assignment 3. I began with setting up Node.js and creating a basic JavaScript file that demonstrates ES6 features like template literals and arrow functions. I tested it both in the terminal and in the browser using DevTools.

In Part 1, I built a responsive calculator styled after iOS/Android interfaces. It supports all basic arithmetic operations, sign toggle, decimal input, percentage, and clearing. I handled user interaction through `addEventListener` and used DOM manipulation to update the display and internal states. The layout uses grid styling to resemble modern smartphone calculators.

Part 2 required integrating the calculator into my portfolio. I added a new project card with a screenshot, project description, and a link to the live calculator. The calculator page includes a working “Back to Portfolio” link and uses consistent styling and layout with the rest of my portfolio. All navigation between pages works smoothly, and the full project is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Lessons Learned

This assignment deepened my understanding of core JavaScript concepts including functions, event listeners, DOM manipulation, and handling user input. I also learned how to debug browser-side JavaScript using DevTools, and how to use Git/GitHub to manage version control across machines. Deploying and maintaining consistent folder structure for GitHub Pages was a valuable technical and organizational skill.

## Additional Features

- **Theme Switcher:** My portfolio includes a working theme switcher with 4 themes (handwritten CSS, 2 AI-generated styles, and a hybrid style).
- Calculator includes a clean UI, grid layout, and styling modeled after mobile devices.
- Proper error handling is built in (e.g. division by zero).

## Validation

All HTML and CSS was validated using the W3C Validator.  
All JavaScript was manually tested across modern browsers.
