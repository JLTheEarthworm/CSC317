## **Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis**

This assignment required me to explore four different methods of styling my portfolio website: writing CSS by hand, generating CSS through an AI text prompt, generating CSS based on an image prompt, and creating a hybrid approach that integrates elements from all three. Each method presented unique strengths and challenges, demonstrating the various ways CSS can be applied to achieve different visual and functional results.

Writing my own CSS allowed for the highest level of control and precision. While it was the most time-intensive approach, it reinforced my understanding of key styling principles such as CSS variables, flexbox, media queries, and responsive design. This method ensured clean, structured, and efficient code that was both performant and accessible.

The AI-generated CSS based on a text prompt provided a quick and creative starting point. The AI introduced design ideas I might not have considered, but the output often required refinement, particularly in terms of structure and accessibility. While it saved time, it lacked the intentionality and optimization that comes with manual coding.

The AI-generated CSS using an image prompt produced visually compelling designs, particularly in terms of color schemes and typography. However, the structural integrity of the layout often needed significant adjustments to ensure proper responsiveness and readability. While this approach was useful for aesthetic inspiration, it required careful fine-tuning.

The hybrid approach emerged as the most effective solution. By combining the AI-generated styles with my own hand-written refinements, I was able to strike a balance between creativity and structure. This approach leveraged AIâ€™s ability to quickly generate modern design elements while maintaining the optimization and organization that come with manual coding.

## **Lessons Learned**

This project highlighted the trade-offs between manual coding and AI-assisted development. Writing CSS from scratch offers the greatest control and precision but is time-consuming. AI-generated styles can serve as useful design inspiration but often require modification to align with best practices. The hybrid approach, which integrates AI-driven creativity with structured manual refinements, proved to be the most effective in achieving both aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency. Additionally, this assignment reinforced the importance of thorough testing and validation to ensure consistency across different screen sizes and devices.

## **Preferred Version**

The hybrid approach was the most effective solution because it combined the best aspects of both manual and AI-generated styling. It allowed me to maintain the clean, structured nature of hand-written CSS while incorporating AI-generated design elements that enhanced the overall visual presentation. This method resulted in a well-balanced, polished design that performed well across various devices and provided an optimal user experience.

## **Validation**

All HTML and CSS files were validated using the W3C validation tools, ensuring compliance with web standards and best practices.

Through this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of different CSS methodologies and their applications. The ability to blend AI-generated styles with manual refinements has broadened my perspective on modern web development, equipping me with valuable skills for creating both efficient and aesthetically pleasing designs.
